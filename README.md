MSc project assignment

## TODOs

* create sample effect: gain/distortion
* split synth and oscillator into two: synth produces a single sample, while the oscillator handles sample packs
* move synth-related data into fields: pitch, amplitude, envelope
* move oscillator-related data into fields: stereo, panning, 3D sound
